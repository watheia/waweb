# Heading

<p>{docs.exports.Heading.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo packageData={packageData} componentNames={["Heading"]} sourceData={[]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Heading level={4}>Edit</Heading>
```

## Content

The `Heading` component represents a heading within a Spectrum container
such as a [Dialog](Dialog.html). `Heading` provides no specific styling by
itself, but receives styling from the parent container. In addition,
`Heading` will be automatically placed within the container's layout
according to Spectrum guidelines.

See [Dialog](Dialog.html#examples) for examples of how to use the
`Heading` component in the context of a Spectrum container.
See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) for more
information about the semantics of heading elements.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Heading} links={docs.links} />
