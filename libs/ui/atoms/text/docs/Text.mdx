<p>{docs.exports.Text.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo packageData={packageData} componentNames={["Text"]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Text>Paste</Text>
```

## Content

The `Text` component represents text with no specific semantic meaning
within a Spectrum container such as a [Button](Button.html) or [Menu](Menu.html).
`Text` provides no styling by itself, but receives styling
from the parent container. In addition, `Text` will be automatically
placed within the container's layout according to Spectrum guidelines.

See [Button](Button.html#content) for examples of how to use the
`Text` component in the context of a Spectrum container.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Text} links={docs.links} />
